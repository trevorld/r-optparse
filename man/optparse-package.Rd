\title{Command line option parser}
\description{
Goal is to create an R package of a command line parser inspired by Python's
\dQuote{optparse} library.
}
\details{
\code{optparse} is primarily intended to be used with
\dQuote{Rscript}. It facilitates writing \dQuote{#!} shebang scripts that
accept short and long flags/options. It can also be used from directly, but
is probably less useful in this context.

See package vignette for a more detailed example.

Notes on naming convention in package: 1. An option is one of the shell-split
input strings. 2. A flag is a type of option. a flag can be defined as having
no argument (defined below), a required argument, or an optional argument. 3.
An argument is a type of option, and is the value associated with a flag. 4.
A long flag is a type of flag, and begins with the string \dQuote{--}. If the
long flag has an associated argument, it may be delimited from the long flag
by either a trailing =, or may be the subsequent option. 5. A short flag is a
type of flag, and begins with the string \dQuote{-}. If a short flag has an
associated argument, it is the subsequent option. short flags may be bundled
together, sharing a single leading \dQuote{"-"}, but only the final short
flag is able to have a corresponding argument. \%\%\%
