optparse 1.3.1
==============
* optparse should no longer give any warnings when options(warnPartialMatchArgs=TRUE).  Thanks Rich FitzJohn for patch.
* print_help no longer throws an error if we have a default argument of length zero.  Thanks Benjamin Tyner for bug report.

optparse 1.3.0
==============
* OptionParser and OptionParserOption are now exported.  Thanks Peter Humburg for patch.

optparse 1.2.0
==============
* Parameter ``positional_arguments`` of function ``parse_args`` now accepts one
  or two numeric values that denote the minimum and maximum number of supported
  positional arguments.
  Thanks Kirill Müller for patch.

* If ``interactive() == TRUE`` then ``parse_args`` will no longer ``quit(status=1)`` after printing a help message
  but will instead throw an error.  ``argparse`` will continue to ``quit(status=1)`` after printing a help message
  for non-interactive Rscripts unless ``print_help_and_exit == FALSE``.

optparse 1.1.0
==============
* In ``make_option`` argument ``type="numeric"`` automatically cast to ``double``.
  Previously users might have received an error passing negative numbers if they
  accidentally specified "numeric" instead of "double".
* Bug fixed in printing usage message for options with default value of NA 
  and a help string including "%default".
  Thanks Stefan Seemayer for bug report and patch.

optparse 1.0.2
==============
* Project website moved to https://github.com/trevorld/optparse
* We now replace all occurrences of %prog in usage message (including description and epilogue).
  Previously we would only replace one occurrence and didn't make replacements in description and epilogue.
* Fix bug in ``parse_args`` when we have options with no short flag and positional_arguments=TRUE.
  Thanks Miroslav Posta for bug report.

optparse 1.0.0
==============
* Added `description` and `epilogue` arguments to `OptionParser` to allow
  users to add more information to generated help messages
* Slightly alters the generated usage string 
  to match more closely what the Python module does
* No longer exports S4 classes that represent OptionParser and OptionParserOption
* Now requires package getopt (>= 1.19) which has also been moved to 
  Imports field from Depends field in DESCRIPTION
* Now also Suggests stringr package in DESCRIPTION
