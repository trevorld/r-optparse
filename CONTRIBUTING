Pull requests are welcome but not guaranteed to be accepted (especially if they break reverse compatibility).
It might be a good idea to submit an issue asking whether such a feature would be accepted before writing a patch.

When submitting a patch please state that you are giving me an non-exclusive Unlimited license to your contribution 
so I have the flexibility of updating the package license in the future while you retain the right to use your code 
on other projects as you see fit as well as the right to fork the version of package that you contributed to.

Additionally, although not required, adding a unit test illustrating a bug or testing the new feature would be much appreciated.
